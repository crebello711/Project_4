# Machine Learning Project
---
### For our final project, we will be investigating the problem of classifying computed tomography scans of lung tissue using machine learning. 
### Our goal is to produce a script that creates, trains, and tests a machine learning model on medical imaging data from CT scans of lung tissue, predicting the classification of either lung cancer or COVID-19. 
Group Members: Douglas Packard, Chris Rebello, Karina Alvarez

### Data Source 1:
[Here](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=70224216) is our first data source. This website consists of CT and PET-CT DICOM images of lung cancer subjects.

### Data Source 2:
[Here](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=89096912) is our second data source. This website contains patients who tested positive for COVID-19 along with their imaging (chest radiographs, chest CTs, brain MRIs, etc.).
