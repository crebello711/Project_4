# Machine Learning Project
---
### Proposal
* For this final project for the class, our group will be investigating the problem of classifying magnetic resonance images of brain tissue using machine learning. 
* Our goal is to produce a script that creates, trains, and tests a machine learning model on medical imaging data from MR scans of brain tissue, predicting the classification (cancers by type, and non-cancerous).
* Data source: https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collections/
* Data analysis and cleaning: Python Pandas
* Data storage: Amazon AWS, SQL Database
* Machine learning: Scikit-learn, Tensorflow
