        "# Summary\n",
        "Interacitve visualization of data is essential to AI research. It is used to validate how the data is being read and pre-processed.  Overlays (labelmaps) on images allow annotations and segmentation results to be evaluated and enable strengths and weaknesses to be identified and documented. Visualization is also critical in communication with collaborators.\n",
        "\n",
        "[The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/) is a public service funded by the National Cancer Institute which addresses this challenge by providing hosting and de-identification services to take major burdens of data sharing off researchers. Its rich collection of clinical data and annotations is particularly powerful as a community resource when it is paired with interactive code systems, such as Jupyter systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "While jupyter systems (jupyter labs, jupyter notebooks, Google CoLab, AWS SageMaker, etc.) are outstanding tools for interactive programming and algorithm sharing, the ability to visualize data within them has traditionally be limited to plots and sparse 2D slices - which are insufficient when dealing with 3D clinical data. This limitation is particularly challenging when using cloud-based jupyter systems such as Google CoLab and AWS Sagemaker.  3D interactive visualization of data when using those cloud systems traditionally requires downloading that data to your local machine and then running a separate visualization application. itkWidgets addresses those visualization challenges by providing interacitve 3D (and 2D) visualizations within the cells of your jupyter scripts.\n",
        "\n",
        "[itkWidgets](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/itkwidgets) allows researchers to visualize images, point sets, and 3D geometry in Jupyter systems (Jupyer notebooks, Jupyter lab, AWS Sagemaker, and Google CoLab). Despite its name, itkWidgets does not require the use of ITK. It can directly visualization numpy arrays, torch tensors, DASK arrays, VTK polydata, and a multitude of other python data structures."
